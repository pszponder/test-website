# Test Website
The purpose of this repository is to test / practice linking repositories to GitHub using SSH.

## Additional Resources
I followed the guide used by Chris Titus which can be found [here](https://christitus.com/ssh-github/).

**NOTE**: When linking your account to GitHub, remember to use the SSH option and not the HTML option in the Quick setup
